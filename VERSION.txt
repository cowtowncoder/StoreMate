0.9.15 (09-Sep-2013)

- Try to improve robustness of BDB-JE error handling wrt Thread.interrupt()
  (occurred during testing)
- Add metadata (time taken, only-fast-stats) for BackendStats exposed

0.9.14 (08-Aug-2013)

- Fix `OperationDiagnostics`, was using from nano-second base
- Update slf4j dependencies

0.9.12 (01-Jul-2013)

#6: Buffer content being written from request into memory buffer, before disk write operation
- Add 'bytes' argument to OperationDiagnostics, file operations; separate out read/write
  operations for diagnostics
- Add `CountingInputStream`

0.9.11 (29-Jun-2013)

- Updated versions of some dependencies

0.9.10 (27-Jun-2013)

- Add more sanity checks in `StorableKey` constructor
- Improve logging of timing information by moving OperationDiagnostics in.
- Implement off-heap buffering for PUT content (to reduce congestion for file writes)

0.9.9 (04-Jun-2013)

- Make `StorableKey` comparable
- Add low-level support for throttling (with `StoreOperationThrottler`),
  to be used by higher-level stores.

0.9.8 (20-May-2013)

#4: Add option to enable 'deferred writes' for BDB backend (NOTE: not used, up
  to implementing stores)
- Improve handling of backend stats a bit; expose env-stats for BDB-JE

0.9.7 (25-Mar-2013)

#3: Add LevelDB/Java - based backend
* Add 'StoreBackend.getEntryStatistics()', 'getIndexStatistics()' for bit
  more access to statistics backend exposes (if any)

0.9.6 (18-Mar-2013)

* Allow configuring of lock timeout: change default from 5 to 7 seconds, due
  to couple of observed cases of hitting the limit
* Improve handling of BDB exceptions; now get converted to StoreExceptions for
  easier handling (wrt alternate backends)

0.9.5 (14-Mar-2013)

* Optimized LZF/GZIP handling via Compressors a bit
* Allow overriding default BDB-JE lockTable count; partitioned lock count
 (for general store)

0.9.4 (01-Mar-2013)

* Minor configurability improvement: allow easier changing of BDB-JE cache
 settings with newer version of config-magic

0.9.3 (25-Feb-2013)

* Add support for conditionally overwriting entries; needed to support "undelete"
 (and possibly for other things in future)

0.9.2 (11-Feb-2013)

* Fixed an issue with BDB backend not handling possible entry offsets
* Added find-methods in StorableKey

0.9.1:

* Fixed problems with hash code handling for empty content (0 must be masked)

0.9.0 (Jan

* Refactoring: promoted base client up to ClusterMate

0.8.8 (12-Jan-2013):

* Added 'StorableStore.iterateEntriesAfterKey()'
* Added 'StorableKey.hasPrefix()'

0.8.7 (16-Dec-2012):
