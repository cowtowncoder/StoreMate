/**
 * Simple container class that can be used for efficient per-thread
 * recycling of an individual byte buffer.
 * Note that an instance of this class MUST be used as a static member
 * of a class; otherwise per-thread semantics DO NOT WORK as expected,
 * and no recycling occurs.
 *<p>
 * The seeming complexity of this class is due to two levels of indirection
 * we need: one to add per-thread scoping, and the other for "soft references"
 * that allow JVM to collect recycled things as garbage, if and as necessary.
 * Because of this we need an intermediate holder object that caller can then
 * hold on to for life-cycle of its buffer: so basically caller just gets
 * holder once, gets a buffer if it needs one, as well as returns it back
 * to holder when it is done.
